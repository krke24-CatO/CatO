# CatO

The Comparative Archeological Theories Ontology (CatO) aims to create a framework to compare archeological and pseudoarcheological theories concerning archeological sites. In particular we have chosen to analyse structures and sites believed to be created by nonhuman entities.

It is designed for an end-of-course project for Knowledge Representation and Knowledge Extraction, taught by Professor Aldo Gangemi during the a.y. 2023/2024 at the University of Bologna, part of the Masterâ€™s program in Digital Humanities and Digital Knowledge.
